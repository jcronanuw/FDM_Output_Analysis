Purpose: This repository contains an R script used to analyze trends of fuels and fire behavior characteristics derived from FCCS fuelbed maps produced during the 50-year Eglin Air Force Base FDM Simulations (github.com/EglinAirForceBase) for Chapter 5 of my dissertation. A prior repository (github.com/FDM_Output_Processing) assigned fuel characteristics and predicted fire behavior to FCCS fuelbeds in each cell of the output maps. There are seven different types of maps describing landscape-scale distribution of fuels, predicted fire behavior, mean fire return interval, and cover type. This script analyzes how these measures change over time for ensemble members in each prescribed fire scenario (50k, 75k, 100k, and 125k acres per year).
